# wish (super super super early alpha, nothing works yet)

The magic shell, where you simply wish for things to happen and we will try our best to make it so.

```sh
# Does various things depending on the current directory
# Is there a binary called "build"?
# Is there a package.json? If so, does it have a script called "build"?
# Is there a deno.json[c]? If so, does it have a task called "build"?
# Is there a make file? If so, is there a rule called build?
# ...
build
```

We think really hard to make things intuitive. Type what makes sense and wish for the best!
